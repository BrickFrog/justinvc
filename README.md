Site built with [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) for personal notes and such. Published as a static site for browsing purposes. All the fonts and javascript are embedded so no arbitrary callouts to google, etc.

Note: As of 2022/06, moving my workflow to org-mode, pondering whether to continue using TW as a display-mechanism for atomic notes / brain dump.
