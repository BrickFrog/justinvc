> Mutation testing, also known as code mutation testing, is a form of white box testing in which testers change specific components of an application's source code to ensure a software test suite will be able to detect the changes. Changes introduced to the software are intended to cause errors in the program.

One such example would be [[mutmut]] in Python.
