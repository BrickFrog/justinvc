* [[Why You Should STILL Read Berserk|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBrUVqZ_pO8]]
** Watched the first part, will watch second part when needed. Used as kickoff to start reading [[Berserk]] - surprisingly good essay on it though, and why it's important and worth reading.
* Got Tachiyomi working, should automatically track manga on tablet.
* Finished [[WeirdWest]].
* Found a tutorial on [[ApacheKafka]] - do tomorrow.
