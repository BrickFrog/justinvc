An extension of [[Redis]] ({{!!url}}) that adds modern data models (ProbabilisticDataStructure (https://redis.io/docs/stack/bloom/), for example) and processing engines, allowing for easier development of real-time applications.

Has many libraries to interact with at a high level, of interest to me is RedisOM for Python.
