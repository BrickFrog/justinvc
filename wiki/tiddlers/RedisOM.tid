While RedisOM refers to the ObjectMapping in general. A set of high-level abstractions that make it easy to model Redis data, I'll specifically be talking about the [[Python]] variant. Interestingly enough, it uses [[Pydantic]] for its data validation.

It seems to be really simple (good way, as in easy to use) allowing easy function calls to interact with [[Redis]], .get(), .find(), .delete(), etc.
