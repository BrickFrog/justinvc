Data composition, engineering, and data science(?)-ish company, haven't used them but have heard of them. Has some neat open source stuff (not necessarily made by them, but acquired).

Have heard pretty good things about them, but from non-technical data scientists, so still a bit wary. Will update if I ever end up using their core commercial products myself, I think.
