[[AppleTV+]] series about a group of friends at an afterparty for their 15th high school reunion. Someone dies, detective shows up, and they have to tell their stories ala [[Rash√¥mon]] (but with a lot more present-time wandering around hijinks).

Overall, pretty good. I didn't guess the ending, so was pleasantly surprised by that. I think it could've maybe been a little bit tighter in how much was spent outside of the respective stories, although, and I'm not sure how much surrounding it will be stuck in my brain even months later. About on-par insofar as bingeable content.
