[[AppleTV+]] series about a group of friends at an afterparty for their 15th high school reunion. Someone dies, detective shows up, and they have to tell their stories ala [[Rash√¥mon]].

Overall, pretty good. I didn't guess the ending, so was pleasantly surprised by that. I think it could've maybe been a little bit tighter in how much was spent outside of the respective stories, although.
