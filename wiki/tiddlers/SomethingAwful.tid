Old early-2000's internet forum. Used to be a user in ~2008 or so. Mostly frequented the LetsPlay forum. A lot of the people I watch on YouTube are holdovers from here. Influenced quite a bit of internet memes and such. Founder basically went a //bit// off his rocker. <<fnote "Even if he was a not good person, RIP">> A lot of people abandoned the site after that.
