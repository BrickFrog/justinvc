<p class="dropcap">H owdy, this is my wiki/blog/site, built in TiddlyWiki. It uses the structure of [[SorenBjornstad]]'s [[Zettelkasten|https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com#]] (a <<wikipedia zettelkasten>>) as a base after reading [[his book|https://groktiddlywiki.com/]] on TiddlyWiki (and to whom I owe most of the credit for figuring this out). <<fnote "Important enough not to be buried in a footnote, also I didn't realize he had a github link set up with most tiddlers already, so I kind of hand assembled things.">> Of course, then a sizeable amount of plugins and personal css edits.</p>

The big ''TL;DR'' of this is that it's to help me remember and draw connections between media I consume or ideas I have. I've read way too many books that have slipped into the ether years down the road. 

Also, to be honest, futzing around with CSS is kind of a vibe for me, akin to mindlessly mining in [[Minecraft]] or something. <<fnote "I'd probably hate it if I had to do it for a job, though">> I've also always had a bit of TechNostalgia for the [[Geocities]] sites of yore, wandering through weird little bustles of content.

''Note: As of 2022/06, moving my workflow to org-mode, pondering whether to continue using TW as a display-mechanism or not.''
