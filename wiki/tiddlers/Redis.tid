"Remote Dirctionary Server", an interesting data structure store where a system is essentially a store and a cache, with data read from memory, and the store used to recreate when needed, e.g. for restarts.

In discussions with friends / other tech workers, the popularity and focus of redis was due to the propoensity of the founder (SalvatoreSanfilippo) to be a bit of a MergeController.
