* Just some notes I random wandered into - 
**"Main differences between process and thread: 
ðŸ”¹ Processes are usually independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process.
ðŸ”¹ Each process has its own memory space. Threads that belong to the same process share the same memory.
ðŸ”¹ A process is a heavyweight operation. It takes more time to create and terminate. 
ðŸ”¹ Context switching is more expensive between processes.
ðŸ”¹ Inter-thread communication is faster for threads."
