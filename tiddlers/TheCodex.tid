> The Codex is a collection of essays written by Scott Alexander that discuss how good reasoning works, how to learn from the institution of science, and different ways society has been and could be designed. It also contains several short interludes containing fictional tales and real-life stories. The essays contained have been widely read within the rationality and effective altruism communities, and have a strong bias towards actually reading the scientific papers being discussed, analysing the arguments closely, and taking the conclusions seriously.
