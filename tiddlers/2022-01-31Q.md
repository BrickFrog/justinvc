>And they asked me how I did it, <br>
and I gave ’em the Scripture text, <br>
‘‘You keep your light so shining <br>
a little in front o’ the next!’’ <br>
They copied all they could follow, <br>
but they couldn’t copy my mind, <br>
And I left ’em sweating and stealing <br>
a year and a half behind. <br>
