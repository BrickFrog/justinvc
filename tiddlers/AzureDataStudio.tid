A JupyterNotebook section of [[Azure]]. Seems to be useful, but I haven't had (much) experience with it yet. Seems to be about the same as the vanilla experience with soeme additional additions for parameterization and such. 

I've seen some workflow demos regarding it, but I'm not sure if it's something that would be better off in Airflow or Luigi
