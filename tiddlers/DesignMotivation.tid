Just random thoughts on design and such, I think one of the more neat things is the difficulty of SEOing TiddlyWiki (Can you? - Look into this); if someone is here it means they either randomly found it or actually intend to read around vs. ending up from google

I originally kept a simple black theme like Gwern, but I found myself gravitating towards Twilight. I like the gold colors.

Things I should figure out

* Better pop-ups for linkgs, difficult to do with, I know Gwern has javascript for how he handles it.
* Best way to handle YouTube sources, a lot of videos are long and might be worthy of being a seperate source, but not sure if it's worth the hassle to source, say, a 15 minute python video that has one core idea that can be summarized in a bullet point
