Just random thoughts on design and such, I think one of the more neat things is the difficulty of SEOing TiddlyWiki (Can you? - Look into this); if someone is here it means they either randomly found it or actually intend to read around vs. ending up from google

Things I should figure out

* Better pop-ups for linkgs, difficult to do with, I know Gwern has javascript for how he handles it.
