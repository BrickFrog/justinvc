Mostly a mechanism to keep track of tech stacks of various companies I watch in presentations, has the potential to go out of date pretty quickly, but theoretically the linking should still (maybe) prove useful. 

Assuming I keep it up to date, watching new things should remind me to update, otherwise (if you're not me), keep an eye on the dates of the tiddler to see how relevant things are.
