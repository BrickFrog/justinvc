title: NoteTaking

Going to keep my amalgamation of notes regarding keeping notes here, or at least ideas insofar as how I should organize things. I need to read more literature on it, I just kind of either go with the flow, so to speak, or kind of adapt others work. So, this is more of "burt things out" section to see what sticks and doesn't

* Idea: use journal tab to keep track of daily watchings, etc. and don't bother to keep a source tiddler for something unless it's either A) long enough (e.g. a 1-2 hour video) or particularly insightful.
** There's a reason behind this, I've been getting a backlog of like 30-40 videos (and ever increasing) on YouTube, specifically with regards to coding/ML, etc. content and frankly, the vast majority is either trash or too introductory to be useful to me - might be a good way of weeding things out
** I also think my mind works better in daily notes, I do have trouble starting things and it seems like just the act of writing about it tends to kick things off
