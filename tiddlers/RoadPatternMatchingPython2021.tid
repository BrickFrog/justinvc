* ''Summary'':
** This talk tries to give an answer and discusses the rationale and ideas behind the recent "pattern matching" PEPs.
* ''Thoughts'':
** More of a hypothetical discussion on pattern matching - interesting but difficult to distill notes from
* ''Notes'':
**  checks the structure/shape/type -> selects code to handle a specific object -> extracts relevant pieces of information
** in the beginning:
*** tuple unpacking
*** new paradigm of coding
**** isolated -> do not affect outside of match
**** familiar -> follow established syntax / conventions
**** compatible -> work well with existing code
*** simple names are binding targets 
*** attributes provide value constraints
*** the set of binding targets is detereministic
*** objects are complex
**** views on different classes?
