<p class="dropcap">H owdy, this is my wiki/blog/site, built in TiddlyWiki. It uses the structure of [[Soren Bjornstad's Zettelkasten|https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com#]] as a base after reading [[his book|https://groktiddlywiki.com/]] on TiddlyWiki (and to whom I owe most of the credit for figuring this out). <<fnote "Important enough not to be buried in a footnote, also I was dumb and didn't realize he had a github link set up with most tiddlers already, so I kind of hand assembled things. Womp womp.">> </p>

The big ''TL;DR'' of this is that it's to help me remember and draw connections between media I consume or ideas I have. I've read way too many books that have slipped into the ether years down the road.

What's in it for you? I dunno, maybe you'll find a movie I watched or concept I learned helpful. I've always had a bit of TechNostalgia for the [[Geocities]] sites of yore, wandering through weird little bustles of content.
