This is a talk on FunctionalProgramming in Python. It first covers functional programming, nice overview, but I skipped abit of it, then a discussion on functional features in python

* Pure functions (sort of)
* Closures
* Functions are objects
* Decorators / higher-order functions
* Immuatable data types (sets, etc.)
* Lazy evaluation - generators
* List comprehensions
* Modules: functools, lambda, map, filter
* Recursion (avoid - recursion limit there for a reason)

more-itertools, toolz, cytoolz Pyrsistent? (never heard of this one)

The rest of the talk is more a demo of various things, such as closures, lambda, statement vs. expression, list comprehensions and map/reduce, etc. etc.
