A series of blog posts on creating your own ProgrammingLanguage with Ocaml, C++, and [[LLVM]].

Supplementary materials:

* [[LLVMSharp|https://github.com/Microsoft/LLVMSharp]] - LLVM bindings for .NET, using C# + ClangSharp
* [[OCaml Dune|https://mukulrathi.co.uk/ocaml-tooling-dune/]] - build system for OCaml
* [[OCaml Testing Frameworks|https://mukulrathi.co.uk/ocaml-testing-frameworks/]]
* [[Bolt documentation|https://mukul-rathi.github.io/bolt/]]

This is actually fascinating stuff, and definitely a TODO to come back to. A little bit over my head right now.
